# ZeroG_Movement_Selection

Rockets, and by extension Spaceships typically have large thrusters for acceleration, as well as smaller thrusters for deceleration and turning.
This demo system demonstrates an implementation of both a selection system and a movement system to simulate conditions in a zero-g environment.

Controls: Mouse + Keyboard (Optional)

The selection system should be familiar to any RTS player:
- left click a unit to select it
- left drag a box to select a group of units
- double left click a unit to select all units of that type on screen (also Ctrl + left click)
- Shift + left click to add/remove units from current selection
- right click to move units

The movement system is implemented similar to the classic arcade game Asteroids:
Units can accelerate/decelerate in the direction they are facing, as well as turn.
